                <p>As a child, video games have been a staple in my daily life. Seeing the various atmospheres, environments, and characters helped spark my creative endeavors into the arts. It may be the nostalgia speaking, but as a child the graphics back then seemed to be realistic enough to perceive myself as if I was the character. At any rate, I digress, but it was eye-opening to grasp that a medium existed that could actively make the viewer immerse themselves in a story or world that could only be considered fiction. </p>

                <p>Creative writing and drawing were various ways I attempted to express myself in the beginning.  Something as simple as writing the vivid dreams I experience and extrapolating how it would continue wound up turning into a habit in my overactive mind. This eventually led to the discovery of various cartoons and anime that still remain an impact in my life. With my overactive imagination, it was easy enough to step into a character‚Äôs shoes and perceive how it would be like. Considering that it was relatable enough despite having different styles or situations that would never happen in real life was interesting to say the very least. If I could say what I got out of it, it would be that I learned what I wanted to focus on.
                </p>

                <p>Currently, while my works are more focused on design and accuracy towards a specific subject, I strive towards creating art that is either relatable or close to reality. Another term I would probably use is that I suppose I strive towards it being immersive. I have always been inclined towards works (whether it be anime or video games) that fully immerses the viewer in the environment. This has led me to focus on learning how to 3D model and, if I am in the mood to draw, learn how to realistically paint digitally. </p>

                <p>Recently, I have dipped my toes into Virtual Reality and that is a medium I plan to eventually learn. As the technology for it is still improving, I plan to stay on top of it and strive towards making something that seems as realistic as life.</p>
